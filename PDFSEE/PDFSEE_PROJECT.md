# PDFSEE - AI-Friendly PDF Visualization & Modification System

## Project Vision

Create software tools that allow AI assistants to "see" and modify PDF files as effectively as humans can, bridging the gap between human visual perception and AI data processing.

## Core Problem

AI assistants can extract data from PDFs but struggle with:

- Understanding spatial relationships between elements
- "Seeing" vector graphics and text rendered as paths
- Identifying visual patterns that are obvious to humans
- Modifying PDF content while preserving structure

## Project Goals

### 1. PDF Visualization for AI

- Extract and interpret all vector elements (30,000+ drawings in typical CAD PDFs)
- Map visual elements to meaningful data structures
- Identify text rendered as vector paths, not just embedded text
- Preserve spatial relationships and positioning

### 2. Pattern Recognition

- Detect recurring visual patterns (like room layouts)
- Match database IDs to visual elements
- Extract implied information from vector arrangements
- Build semantic understanding of floor plans and technical drawings

### 3. PDF Modification Capabilities

- Add/edit annotations and markers
- Modify vector paths and shapes
- Insert text overlays while preserving vector base
- Maintain PDF structure and compatibility

## Current Test Case: Rio Grande Regional Hospital

**File**: `RIO GRANDE REGIONAL/RG_SP_01.pdf`

- AutoCAD-generated floor plan
- 595 embedded hyperlinks to room database
- Room names visible as vectors but not extractable as text
- 30,131 vector drawings total
- No embedded fonts or text objects

### Discovered Patterns

- Room IDs are hex codes (e.g., 7742, 7775, 77A8)
- Sequential rooms increment by 51 (0x33 hex)
- Links connect to ATG asset management system
- Each room has position, ID, and database connection

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Vector Analysis

- Parse all drawing commands in PDF
- Group vectors into logical units (text characters, room outlines)
- Develop vector-to-text recognition for CAD-style lettering

### Phase 2: Spatial Mapping

- Create coordinate-based element registry
- Build proximity relationships between elements
- Generate semantic maps of PDF content

### Phase 3: Interactive Interface

- Develop tools for AI to query PDF regions
- Enable point-and-identify functionality
- Create modification API for adding/editing content

## Development Strategy

1. **Start with read-only analysis** - Understanding before modifying
2. **Focus on CAD/technical PDFs** - Highest value use case
3. **Build incremental capabilities** - Each tool should work standalone
4. **Maintain PDF compatibility** - Changes must not break original functionality

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Extract room names from vector-only PDFs
- [ ] Map all hyperlinks to visual locations
- [ ] Identify and group related vector elements
- [ ] Enable AI to "see" PDF layout spatially
- [ ] Modify PDFs while preserving structure

## Tools & Technologies

- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: Core PDF manipulation
- **Python**: Processing and analysis
- **HTML/JS**: Visualization interfaces
- **Vector analysis**: Custom algorithms for path interpretation

## Next Steps

1. Analyze vector drawing commands in detail
2. Develop vector-to-text recognition
3. Build spatial relationship mapper
4. Create AI-friendly query interface
5. Test with various PDF types

_This project aims to give AI assistants visual understanding of PDFs, enabling them to work with technical drawings, floor plans, and complex documents as naturally as humans do._
