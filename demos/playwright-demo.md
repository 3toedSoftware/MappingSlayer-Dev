# Playwright MCP Server Demo

## ✅ STATUS: WORKING!

**Successfully connected** using Microsoft's official `@playwright/mcp` package.

## What is Playwright MCP?

Playwright MCP gives Claude advanced browser automation capabilities:
- **Multi-browser support** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari/WebKit)
- **More reliable element detection** using accessibility trees
- **Better canvas interaction** for testing Mapping Slayer
- **Network interception** for API testing
- **Mobile device emulation**
- **Video recording** of test runs

## Why We Chose Playwright Over Puppeteer

| Feature | Puppeteer | Playwright |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Browsers | Chrome only | Chrome, Firefox, Safari |
| Speed | Fast | Faster |
| Canvas Testing | Basic | Advanced |
| Reliability | Good | Excellent |
| Mobile Testing | Limited | Full emulation |
| MCP Package | Deprecated ❌ | Active ✅ |
| Maintainer | Google | Microsoft |

**Decision:** Puppeteer MCP was removed because:
1. The MCP package is deprecated
2. Playwright does everything Puppeteer does
3. Playwright adds multi-browser support
4. Microsoft's official MCP package is actively maintained

## How It Works with Mapping Slayer

After restarting Claude Code, you can tell me things like:

1. **"Test marker placement across all browsers"**
   - Claude tests in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
   - Ensures cross-browser compatibility
   - Reports any browser-specific issues

2. **"Test canvas interactions with accessibility"**
   - Uses accessibility trees to find elements
   - Better for testing Mapping Slayer's canvas
   - Can interact with rendered canvas elements

3. **"Record a video of the entire workflow"**
   - Records user interactions
   - Helpful for debugging issues
   - Creates visual documentation

4. **"Test on mobile viewport"**
   - Emulates iPhone, iPad, Android devices
   - Tests responsive design
   - Checks touch interactions

## Example Commands After Restart

```
"Use Playwright to open Mapping Slayer and take a screenshot"
"Test if the Edit Location button works in Firefox and Chrome"
"Record a video of adding 10 markers to the map"
"Test Mapping Slayer on iPhone 14 viewport"
"Check if PDF upload works and capture the network requests"
"Test the canvas interactions - add marker at specific coordinates"
"Verify the export functionality across all browsers"
```

## Specific Mapping Slayer Tests

### Canvas Testing
```
"Click on specific coordinates in the canvas"
"Verify marker appears at exact position"
"Test drag and drop of markers"
"Check canvas rendering performance"
```

### Cross-browser Testing
```
"Test PDF rendering in Firefox"
"Check if modals work in Safari"
"Verify export works in all browsers"
```

### Performance Testing
```
"Measure time to load 100 markers"
"Check memory usage during long sessions"
"Test with large PDF files"
```

## Key Benefits for Mapping Slayer

- **Canvas-heavy app testing**: Playwright excels at testing canvas elements
- **Cross-browser assurance**: Test once, works everywhere
- **Accessibility compliance**: Built-in accessibility testing
- **Performance metrics**: Get detailed performance data
