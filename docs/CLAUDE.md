# Claude Code Instructions for Mapping Slayer

## Project Overview

Mapping Slayer is a professional sign mapping platform for creating detailed maps with marker placement, PDF integration, and comprehensive project management.

### Sidekick AI Note

The Sidekick AI feature in Mapping Slayer is an API/backend system without a human-facing UI. It includes:

- `ai-interface.js` - AI integration code
- `sidekick-examples.json` - Example prompts/responses
- Documentation files (SIDEKICK_README.md, SIDEKICK_AI_GUIDE.md)

**Important**: There is no user interface for Sidekick - it's designed as a backend system for AI assistants to interact with, not for direct human use.

### Sidekick Workflow for Users

**If user has NO existing work:**

1. Ask Claude to help with Mapping Slayer
2. Claude opens a special browser window
3. User works normally in that window (load PDF, add markers, etc.)
4. User asks Claude to automate tasks
5. Claude uses Sidekick to control that same window

**If user ALREADY has work in progress:**

1. Save your work using SAVE or SAVE AS button in Mapping Slayer
2. Tell Claude you have existing work saved
3. Claude opens a special browser window
4. Use the LOAD button to load your .slayer file
5. All your work appears in Claude's window
6. Claude can now automate tasks on your existing work

**Key Points:**

- Claude needs a special debugging-enabled browser window to use Sidekick
- Your regular browser window can't be controlled by Claude
- The save/load process bridges your work to Claude's window
- Once loaded, Claude can see and control everything in that window

## Testing Protocol

### Automatic Test Execution

Run tests automatically when:

1. User reports any error or issue
2. After completing any code modifications to core systems
3. When multiple files (>3) have been changed
4. Before confirming task completion
5. When user asks to "check", "verify", or "test" anything

### Test Commands

```bash
# Start dev server in background (Ctrl+B)
npm run dev

# Run integration tests
npm test

# Watch mode for continuous testing
npm run test:watch
```

### Critical Files Requiring Tests

If any of these files are modified, ALWAYS run tests:

- `core/app-bridge.js`
- `core/sync-manager.js`
- `core/slayer-app-base.js`
- Any `state.js` file
- Any `*-app.js` file
- Canvas-related files
- Event handling code

## Error Handling Protocol

### When User Reports an Issue:

1. Start dev server in background: `npm run dev`
2. Run test suite: `npm test`
3. Analyze all errors found
4. Apply auto-fixes for known patterns
5. Re-run tests to verify fixes
6. Report any remaining issues that need manual attention

### Auto-Fixable Patterns:

- Null/undefined reference errors → Add null checks
- Missing functions → Add type validation
- Memory leaks → Add cleanup code
- Network failures → Add retry logic
- Missing awaits → Add async/await

## Development Workflow

### For New Features:

1. Implement the feature
2. Run tests to ensure no breakage
3. Add specific tests for new functionality
4. Verify all tests pass

### For Bug Fixes:

1. Run tests to reproduce the issue
2. Implement the fix
3. Run tests to verify resolution
4. Ensure no regression

### For Refactoring:

1. Run tests to establish baseline
2. Make refactoring changes
3. Run tests to ensure functionality preserved
4. Check performance metrics

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch:

- App initialization time: < 2 seconds
- Canvas render time: < 100ms for 1000 elements
- Memory growth: < 5MB per operation
- No memory leaks after repeated operations

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:8080

# Quick test run
npm test

# Full test with visible browser
npm test -- --headed

# Test specific app
node test-runner.js --app=mapping

# Kill all node processes (if needed)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

## Code Quality Workflow

### Using ESLint for Code Quality

Mapping Slayer uses ESLint for maintaining code quality and consistency.

### Linting Commands

```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Automatically fix fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### When to Run Linting

1. **Before commits**: Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
2. **After writing code**: Use `npm run lint:fix` to auto-format
3. **During code review**: Ensure no linting errors exist
4. **Regular maintenance**: Keep code style consistent

### ESLint Configuration

The project uses a modern ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`) that:

- Enforces consistent code style
- Catches common errors
- Identifies unused variables
- Maintains code quality standards

## Git Management

### When User Requests Git Saves:

The user prefers not to use git directly. When they say:

- "git this"
- "save checkpoint"
- "commit this"
- "save before I change things"

Automatically:

1. Check what changed: `git status` and `git diff`
2. Create helpful commit message based on actual changes
3. Run: `git add .` and `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
4. Confirm checkpoint was saved

### Commit Message Format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `style:` - CSS/visual changes only
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `docs:` - Documentation updates

### Example Messages:

- "style: updated header colors and button alignment"
- "fix: resolved canvas rendering issue in Mapping Slayer"
- "feat: added grid snapping to Design Slayer"

## Chrome DevTools Integration

### MCP Server for Browser Console Access

The Chrome DevTools MCP server is installed to allow direct access to browser console errors and debugging information.

### Setup (Already Completed)

The Chrome DevTools MCP server has been installed and configured:

- Location: `C:\Users\iam3toed\Desktop\mapping-slayer-dev\chrome-devtools-mcp\`
- Configuration: Added to Claude MCP servers
- Port: 9222 (Chrome remote debugging port)

### Using Chrome DevTools MCP

When debugging browser issues:

1. **Start Chrome with debugging enabled**:

```bash
# Windows
start chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 "http://localhost:8080/src/app/mapping_slayer.html"

# Or just the redirect page
chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=temp-profile "http://localhost:8080"
```

2. **After restarting Claude Code session**, MCP tools will be available with `mcp__` prefix to:

- Connect to running Chrome instances
- Read console logs and errors directly
- Execute JavaScript in browser context
- Inspect DOM elements
- Monitor network requests
- Analyze performance metrics

3. **Benefits**:

- No need to copy/paste console errors
- Direct access to browser debugging
- Real-time monitoring of JavaScript errors
- Automated error detection and analysis

### Test Page Available

A test page with various console outputs and errors is available at:

```
test-console-errors.html
```

This can be used to verify the Chrome DevTools MCP connection is working properly.

## Collaboration Style

### Working Together

- **Be honest about limitations**: Say "I don't know" when uncertain rather than guessing
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Use phrases like "let's figure it out together" to emphasize partnership
- **Ask clarifying questions**: Don't hesitate to ask the user for more information or guidance
- **Learn from the user**: The user often knows the best approach - lean on their expertise
- **Slow down when needed**: Don't rush ahead without the user - remember "we're doing this together"
- **Admit mistakes**: If something doesn't work as expected, acknowledge it and try a different approach
- **NEVER claim something is "Fixed!" without verification**: Don't assume fixes work - test them first or say "I think this might fix it, let's test"
- **Ask before taking action**: Especially with browser connections - explain what you want to do and why before doing it

### Example Phrases to Use:

- "I don't know exactly, but let's figure it out together"
- "You're right to question that - let me reconsider"
- "I'm not sure about this, what do you think?"
- "Hold on, let me work through this with you"
- "That's a good point - I was mistaken"
- "Can you help me understand..."
- "Should we try a different approach?"
- "I made a change that should fix it - want to test it together?"
- "Let me connect to your browser to check something - is that okay?"

## Remember:

- Always run tests after significant changes
- Use background server (Ctrl+B) for continuous development
- Auto-fix common errors without asking
- Only request manual testing for visual/UX issues
- Keep test suite updated with new features
- Run ESLint (`npm run lint`) before commits
- Use `npm run lint:fix` to maintain code consistency
- Handle git commits when user requests with descriptive messages
- Chrome DevTools MCP requires Claude Code restart to load MCP tools
- Start Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` for console access
- Be honest about what you don't know - it's better than guessing wrong
- Work collaboratively with the user - you're a team
